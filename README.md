# LibreOffice Calc template

A [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) template to keep track for the [JavaSpecialists](https://www.javaspecialists.eu) [15000 Push-ups challenge](https://www.javaspecialists.eu/challenges/15000push-ups-thanks.jsp).

It's based on the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYyFzGFnWlhqS0W04wiNUVMvrmy1ttMRq-UAzjxjuBI/edit#gid=0) from [Justin Lee](https://github.com/evanchooly)

The spreadsheet keeps track of

 - daily push-up target in the month
 - remaining push-ups for the month, to reach the goal
 - loss in weight (which might happen)
